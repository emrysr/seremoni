As a consequence of this love they have drawn closer to one another and now wish to offer to each other the security that comes from legally binding vows, sincerely made and faithfully kept. You are here to witness this occasion and to share the joy which is theirs.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c5">AND / OR</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c7">Option 2</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Marriage joins two people who trust the love that they have found. &nbsp;It is a partnership in which each can grow and be their true selves, whilst sharing in the development of the other. &nbsp;It is a statement to all those around them of what the two of them know &ndash; namely that they have found such love, friendship and support that they wish to share for the rest of their lives. &nbsp; This marriage ceremony provides the opportunity to bring friends and family together in one place, to impart this message of love and commitment, and for everyone here today to celebrate the happiness of the married couple.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c5">AND / OR</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c7">Option 3</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Marriage is a desire by two people to share themselves and their experiences with each other, and a willingness to accept each other for who they are. Marriage means making a commitment to developing co-operation, friendship and mutual respect. It calls for honesty, patience and, of course, humour. Marriage is where each partner cares for the other and supports them in all that they do.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It demands courage &ndash; the courage to be open, the courage to grow and change, and the courage to sort out together the tasks of everyday living. Marriage requires closeness and distance &ndash; the closeness of a couple growing together, and enough distance to allow each partner to be individual. A good partner in such a marriage will be loving, caring, and above all, a best friend. </span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It is in this spirit that _______________________ &nbsp;and _______________________ are now before us. In each other&rsquo;s company they have found happiness, fulfilment and love. They now wish to affirm their relationship with this marriage.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c5">AND / OR</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c7">Option 4</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A successful marriage is one where each partner discovers that it is better to give love than to receive it. To truly love another person is to wish that person to develop and flourish in his or her own terms. </span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">In a long marriage there will be joy and laughter, but also sadness and sorrow, harmony and discord, as you strive to overcome adversity and fulfil your dreams.<br><br>The key value of wedlock is that it allows for intimacy between a woman and a man, who can enjoy each other&#39;s company, share ideals and expectations, confess failures and admit defeats to each other, and yet realise in union the qualities of the good life.<br><br>Your marriage can become a work of art in which both of you together give it line and form, colour and tone. You will be challenged every day to make your marriage work. If you do, it can become a thing of beauty, a joint creation of aesthetic splendour and enduring value.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c3"><span class="c2">&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Reading (optional)</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Can I please ask _______________________ to come forward for a reading.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c3"><span class="c2">&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Definition of Marriage</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before you are joined in matrimony, I have to remind you of the solemn and binding character of the ceremony of marriage.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Marriage, according to the law of this country is the union of one man with one woman, voluntarily entered into for life to the exclusion of all others.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is the legal definition: but marriage as we all know, is more than just a legal contract. A successful marriage is where two people, living together as husband and wife, also love and respect each other; - they have confidence in the trust that they have in one another, they are able to share in each other&rsquo;s joys and sorrows, they care and support each other, not only through the good times but also through the difficult times which inevitably visit every marriage on occasions. We hope and trust that all these things will be a reality for you both in your married life together.</span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The union you enter into has to be done voluntarily and I ask each of you, therefore, this question: &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Do you _______________________ by your own choice, enter into the union of marriage with _______________________ &nbsp;?
